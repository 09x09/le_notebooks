#### Karnaugh Map(K-map)

 Rules:

- circle 1,2,4,8 adjacent "1"s (as many as possible). Each circle is a term in the final expression
- If the same circle contains a variable and it's complement, remove the variable from the term
-  Combine all terms with OR

#### Thevenin theorem

Any linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source V<sub>th</sub> in series with a resistor R<sub>th</sub> where V<sub>th</sub> is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals and R<sub>th</sub> is the equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent source is turned off

#### Norton theorem

Any linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source I<sub>N</sub> in parallel with a resistor R<sub>N</sub> where I<sub>N</sub> is the short-circuit current through the terminals and R<sub>N</sub> is the equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent source is turned off

#### Diodes

- 2 terminal device that allows 1-way electric current flow

# Week 4<a name="4"></a>

#### Diode applications

Transformer

- step down AC voltage amplitude
- Isolate equipment from power line

Rectifier

- converts ac to dc

Filter

- converts pulsating input to nearly constant dc output

Regulator

- reduce ripple of dc voltage

#### Small signal analysis

- AC signal with fairly small varying voltages that is centered around DC operating point of non linear devices
- enables approximation of non-linear device as linear device
- important for applications where signal distortion cant be tolerated
- needed for wireless communication
- $v_D = V_D + v_d$

> V<sub>D</sub> : DC voltage component(average voltage)

> v<sub>D</sub> : total voltage at time t

> v<sub>d</sub> : time varying voltage component



**Q(quiescent point**)

- the point on the forward bias I-V curve of the diode where the operation of the diode is set
- small signal analysis is performed at Q point by perturbing the voltage by a small amount and observing the resulting linear current perturbation

**Dynamic resistance($r_d$)**

- Close points on the I-V curve can be approximated by a straight line
- $r_d = \frac{\Delta V_D}{\Delta I_D}$
- $i_d(t) = \frac{1}{r_d}v_d(t)$

**Simplified expression**

$i_D = I_D+i_d \approx I_D + \frac{v_d}{r_d}$
