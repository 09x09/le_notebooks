    "Chapter 1: The Way of the Program:\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Program?\n",
    "Programs are sequences of instructions that specify how to perform certain computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is hence the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until they're simple enough to fall into these certain categories of basic instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *input*: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device\n",
    "* *output*: Display data on the screen, or send data to some other device\n",
    "* *math*: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication\n",
    "* *conditional execution*: Check for certain conditions, and execute appropriate instructions\n",
    "* *repetition*: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Quick Glossary of Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is error-prone, and errors are termed __bugs__, and the process of tracking them down is called __debugging__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Errors\n",
    "Programming languages can only execute programs fully if the syntax (the grammar) is correct. Otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message. __Syntax__ refers to the structure of the program, and what rules it has to obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. parentheses \"()\" have to come in matching pairs, so `(1+2)` is legal, but `8)` throws up a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime Errors\n",
    "Runtime errors are exactly as they describe: Errors that don't happen until the program starts running. They are also called **exceptions** because they indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're quite rare because they usually occur in larger programs, where there's more to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Errors\n",
    "If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that the program logic you've written is not what you intended to write. It usually requires work to figure out where the logic goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Debugging\n",
    "While annoying, debugging is one of the most rewarding and interesting parts of programming, at least for people who like intellectual challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, it's like detective work, while debugging, in a way, is also a kind of programming - you're programming to get the computer to work the way you intended the program to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal And Natural Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language\n",
    "Usually evolves naturally (**duh**). Doesn't always have proper rules that must always be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Language\n",
    "Designed by people for specific applications, and has a specific **_Syntax_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `3 + 2 = 5` is an okay mathematical expression, but: `3+ = 52**` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reading a language so that you understand its meaning is called **parsing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences between Natural & Formal Language:\n",
    "* **Ambiguity**\n",
    "While natural language is full of ambiguity, where people develop meaning from context and textual clues, formal language is designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, where any statement has exactly one meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundancy**\n",
    "In order to make up for the ambiguity of Natural Language, they employ a lot of redundancy. As a result, it's quite verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Literalness**\n",
    "Natural languages are full of additional symbolic meanings beyond the definitions of their words.\n",
    "Formal languages mean literally what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparing Formal & Natural Language through Poetry and Prose\n",
    "* **Poetry**\n",
    "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prose**\n",
    "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Program**\n",
    "The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Babby's First Program\n",
    "Traditionally, it's something that shows the phrase \"Hello, World!\" on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python 3, it's expressed as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "which nets you the result \"hello, world!\" on your screen when run.\n"

    "Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, Statements\n",
    "======\n",
    "## Values and Types\n",
    "A *Value* is one of the basic things that a program will work with, like a number, or some letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have **types**:\n",
    "1. `2` is an integer\n",
    "2. `\"hello world!\"` is a string (named so because it's a 'string' of letters, and identified by quotation marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsure what type the value you're looking at is, the Python interpreter can tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type('Hello, World!')\n",
    "<type 'str'>\n",
    ">>> type(17)\n",
    "<type 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`'str'` is the shortform for string, and `'int'` is the shortform for integer. Other, less-obvious types include `'float'`, or floating-point numbers (decimals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other quirks occur when you try to enter numbers in human-readable format into the interpreter:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 1,000,000\n",
    "(1, 0, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Not exactly what we expected at all. Python instead interprets the numbers entered as comma-separated integers - which is the first example of a _**Semantic Error**_: The code runs fine, but not to our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of any programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**.\n",
    "Variables are names that in turn refer to specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **assignment statement** creates new variables and gives them values:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> message = 'And now for something completely different'\n",
    ">>> n = 17\n",
    ">>> pi = 3.1415926535897932\n",
    "```\n",
    ">Note:\n",
    ">Python is practically unique in its handling of variables - it automatically assigns them types based on the input you hand to it. You may have noticed this in our earlier semantic error: '1,000,000' somehow means '1,0,0' to the interpreter. This is part of the more human-friendly philosophy behind Python. It believes that people shouldn't have to manually define variables every time they need them, and specify their use. Also, Python's remarkably flexible about assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes three assignments:\n",
    "The first assigns a string to a variable named _message_.\n",
    "The second assigns the integer 17 to a variable named _n_.\n",
    "The third assigns a floating point number to a variable named _pi_.\n",
    "\n",
    "On paper, you use a ***state diagram*** to represent the variables, with arrows pointing to the variable's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Names and Keywords\n",
    "Programmers generally choose names for their variables such that they are meaningful - they should document what the variable is for.\n",
    "Variables can have arbitrary name lengths. They can contain both letters and numbers, but _**MUST**_ start with a letter. You _can_ choose to use uppercase letters first, but it's better practice to begin variable names with lowercase letters first. (This will be explained later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscore character, `_`, can appear in names - they're usually used in names with multiple words, like `airspeed_of_unladen_swallow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you give a variable an illegal name, you'll get a syntax error.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 76trombones = 'big parade'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    ">>> more@ = 1000000\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    ">>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`76trombones` is illegal because it starts with a number. `more@` is illegal because it contains an illegal character, and `class` is illegal... because the word 'class' is a reserved name for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note:\n",
    ">Python has things like reserved names because of the nature of its readability - it'll be much the same for other languages too, since, well, they all need some sort of language for communicating in, but Python especially, since it needs those names to manage its internal functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreters use **keywords** to identify the structure of a program, and it just so happens that `class` is one of them, so they can't be used as variable names - they're _reserved_ names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of names for Python 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "and del from not while\n",
    "as elif global or with\n",
    "assert else if pass yield\n",
    "break except import print\n",
    "class nonlocal in raise\n",
    "continue finally is return\n",
    "def for lambda try\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators and Operands\n",
    "**Operators** are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values which you apply these operations to are called **operands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators `+,-,*,/,//,%` and `**` addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo and exponentiation, as in the following examples:\n",
    "```\n",
    "20+32 hour-1 hour*60+minute minute/60 5**2 (5+9)*(15-7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In some other languages, ^ is used for expoentiation, but in Python, it's a bitwise operator called *eXclusive OR*, or **XOR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3, fortunately, supports normal division correctly now - floor division is a thing of the past, and the old errors regarding 5/3 don't give you rubbish truncated results like 1 now. If you still want those truncated results, use the `//` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Statements\n",
    "An **expression** is a combination of values, variables and operators. A value by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so all of these are legal combinations, assuming that `x` has been assigned a value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "17\n",
    "x\n",
    "x + 17\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment. The important difference between statements and expressions are that *expressions have values*, but *statements do not*."

    "Functions\n",
    "=====\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Calls:\n",
    "A **Function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.\n",
    "When you define a function, you specify to the computer a _name_ and the sequence of statements. Later on, you will be able to 'call' the function by its name and have it execute whatever is in its code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to say that a function 'takes' an argument and 'returns' a result. The result is called the **return** value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Conversion Functions:\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions that convert values from a type to another. For example: The `int` function takes a value in and converts it to an integer (if it can). Otherwise, it throws up an error.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> int('32')\n",
    "32\n",
    ">>> int('Hello')\n",
    "ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`int` can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn't _round off_, It instead just chops off the part with the fraction (this is known as **truncation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`float` converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> float(32)\n",
    "32.0\n",
    ">>> float('3.14159')\n",
    "3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, `str` converts its argument to a string:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> str(32)\n",
    "'32'\n",
    ">>> str(3.14159)\n",
    "'3.14159'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Math Functions:\n",
    "Python has the functions needed to do mathematical things - like sine, consine, etc. This is encapsulated in something called a **module**. Modules are files that contain a collection of related functions (a.k.a, a **library**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use any module, we must _import_ it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a **module object** called math - if you print the object, it tells you a little about it:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print math\n",
    "<module 'math' (built-in)>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The module object contains the functions and variables that are defined in the module's file. To access these functions, what you do is you do`[module name].[function/variable name]`. This format, with the dot, is known as *dot notation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\n",
    ">>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\n",
    ">>> radians = 0.7\n",
    ">>> height = math.sin(radians)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example above, `math.log10(ratio)` computes the base-10 logarithm of the ratio. The math module also provides `log`, which computes it with base-*e*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function, `math.sin(radians)`, returns you the sine of `radians`. Importantly, if you are ever unsure of a function in a module, you can simply call up the help function inside of the interpreter (IDLE) in this format:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> help(modulename.modulefunction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will explain how the functions process inputs and what their expected outputs are, at least for the built-in functions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composition:\n",
    "So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of programming languages is the ability to combine them in a chain. For example, the input to a function can be any kind of expression - including the results of other functions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)\n",
    "x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Almost anywhere you could put a value, you can place an arbitrary expression, with one general rule: the ***left-hand side*** must always be a variable name (with some exceptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding New Functions (Making your own)\n",
    "It is possible in Python to define your own new functions - in fact, this is a common feature of programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **function definition** specifies the name of your new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def print_lyrics():\n",
    "print \"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\"\n",
    "print \"I sleep all night and I work all day.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "`def` is a keyword that indicates to Python that this is a function definition. The name of this function is `print_lyrics`. The rules for function names is the same as the rules for variable names - letters, numbers, some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can't be a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't use a keyword as a name for a function, and you should avoid having variables and functions with the same names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty parentheses after the name indicates that this function doesn't take any inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the function is called a **header** - the rest of it is called the **body**. The header _must_ end with a colon, and the body must be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the indentation is four spaces (or one tab stop.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interactive mode (IDLE), the printer prints ellipses (...) to let you know that you haven't finished defining it.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> def print_lyrics():\n",
    "... print \"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\"\n",
    "... print \"I sleep all night and I work all day.\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script).\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print print_lyrics\n",
    "<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>\n",
    ">>> type(print_lyrics)\n",
    "<type 'function'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value of `print_lyrics` is a function object, which has type 'function'.\n",
    "The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print_lyrics()\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def repeat_lyrics():\n",
    "print_lyrics()\n",
    "print_lyrics()\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then call repeat_lyrics:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> repeat_lyrics()\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\n",
    "I sleep all night and I work all day.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions and uses:\n",
    "Function definitions get executed like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements in them don't get executed until called, and the definition itself generates no output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, you must define a function earlier in the code that when you first call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow of Execution:\n",
    "To ensure that you define functions before its first use, you need to know the order in which statements are executed (the **flow of execution**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution starts at the first statement (obviously). Function definitions don't alter the flow of the execution, but remember that statements in a function aren't executed until the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a function call does is that it jumps to that definition, runs all the code within the body, and then returns to your regularly-scheduled programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters and Arguments:\n",
    "Some of the built-in functions we've seen require arguments. Some take more than one, some only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a function, the arguments that you *pass into* the functions are assigned to variables called **parameters**. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def print_twice(line):\n",
    "    print line\n",
    "    print line\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the *argument* that you pass in is assigned to the *parameter* called `line`. When the function is called, it prints the value of the parameter  twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions apply to user-defined functions as well, so you can place any type of expression into the argument for our function above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument gets evaluated before the function gets called, so in the examples, the expressions get evaluated once.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use variables as arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'\n",
    ">>> print_twice(michael)\n",
    "Eric, the half a bee.\n",
    "Eric, the half a bee.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The name of the variable we pass as an argument (`michael`) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (`line`). It doesn't matter to the function what the value was called previously - here in the function, only `line` matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable-Parameter Locality\n",
    "When you create variables within function code blocks, they are **fully local**, which means that it only exists within the function, and cannot be called outside ot it. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def conc_two(one, two):\n",
    "    cat = one + two\n",
    "    print cat\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function takes in the arguments `one` and `two`, concatenates them, and then prints the result twice. Once the `conc_two()` function call terminates, the variable `cat` is destroyed - if we try to print it outside of the function, it returns an exception:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print cat\n",
    "NameError: name 'cat' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parameters are also fully local: outside of `print_twice`, `line` doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Diagrams:\n",
    "To help you keep track of things happening, it may be useful to draw a **stack diagram**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each function is represented in a frame, and arranged in a stacked up form which indicates which function called which, and so on. Note that your core module should always be at the top - after all, it's the first thing that's actually being run.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create variables outside of a function, they belong to `__main__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, and the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called that, all the way back to `__main__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to access `cat` from `within print_twice`, you get a NameError:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (innermost last):\n",
    "File \"test.py\", line 13, in __main__\n",
    "cat_twice(line1, line2)\n",
    "File \"test.py\", line 5, in cat_twice\n",
    "print_twice(cat)\n",
    "File \"test.py\", line 9, in print_twice\n",
    "print cat\n",
    "NameError: name 'cat' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "This list of functions is called a traceback. It tells you what program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that caused the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fruitful Functions and void functions:\n",
    "Some of the functions, which we are using, like `math` functions, yield you results: Let's term them *fruitful functions*. Other functions, merely do things but don't return values. These are called **void functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call fruitful functions, you're almost always looking to do something with them - for example, you may assign them to some variable, or use them as part of an expression:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = math.cos(radians)\n",
    "golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you call functions in the interactive mode (IDLE), Python will display results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a script, if you just call the fruitful function all by itself, the return values are lost forever!\n",
    "Since you don't store or display the result, it's not very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Void functions, on the other hand, don't have a return value. Hence, they usually do something or have some other effect like printing values out. If you try to assign void functions' results to a variable, you end up with a very special value called `None`.\n",

    "## Why Functions?\n",
    "There are several reasons why functions are useful and important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating functions allow you to name a group of statements which makes programs easier to read and debug\n",
    "* Functions make programs smaller by eliminating repetitive code - if you have to make a change, you need only make it in one place.\n",
    "* Dividing longer programs into functions allow you to debug each part individually, and then assemble them into a whole.\n",
    "* Well designed general functions are useful for many programs - once written and debugged, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing with `from`\n",
    "Python provides you with two tools for importing modules - we know direct `import`:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> import math\n",
    ">>> print math\n",
    "<module 'math' (built-in)>\n",
    ">>> print math.pi\n",
    "3.14159265359\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you import this way and try to access things directly, you get errors:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print pi\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "NameError: name 'pi' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because of the aforementioned locality of parameters within a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, you can import specific objects from a module:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> from math import pi\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows you to access `pi` directly without the dot notation.\n",
    "Or you can use the `*` operator to import *everything* from the module so that you need not use dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of doing so is that it makes your code more readable because you don't have to type '`math.`' before each part - but the flipside is that there may be naming conflicts between variables in differing modules, or between module variables and your variables."

    "## The Modulus Operator:\n",
    "The modulus operator works on integers and floats and returns the remainder in whatever format you feed it - float for float, integer for integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the **modulus** operator is `%`. The syntax is exactly the same as other operations.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> quotient = 7 // 3\n",
    ">>> print quotient\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> remainder = 7 % 3\n",
    ">>> print remainder\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another—if `x % y` is zero, then x is divisible by y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits (aka the smallest ones) from a number. For example, `x % 10` yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly `x % 100` yields the last two digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boolean Expressions\n",
    "A **boolean expression** is an expression with only two states: True and False. The operator `==` compares two operands and produces True if they are equal and False otherwise:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 5 == 5\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>> 5 == 6\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "True and False are special values that belong to the type bool; they are not strings:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type(True)\n",
    "<type 'bool'>\n",
    ">>> type(False)\n",
    "<type 'bool'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Other operators exist for use of logic:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x != y # x is not equal to y\n",
    "x > y  # x is greater than y\n",
    "x < y  # x is less than y\n",
    "x >= y # x is greater than or equal to y\n",
    "x <= y # x is less than or equal to y\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although these operators are probably familiar, remember that the `=` sign is for assignment and that `==` is for comparison!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Operations:\n",
    "There are 3 logical operators: `and, or, not`. The meaning of each of these are pretty much the same as in English:\n",
    "* `A and B` means that both A and B must be true for the overall condition to be True.\n",
    "* `A or B` means that for the statement to be true, only one of the conditions needs to be true, although it will also be true if both of them are.\n",
    "* `not A` means that the statement will be true if A is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, unlike other languages, is quite relaxed about the nature of what you feed into the operators. Any non-zero number you feed into it is treated by default as \"True\", although by right they should be Boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Execution\n",
    "In order for us to write useful programs, we almost always need to be able to have the program check things and change behaviours accordingly. **Conditional Statements** allow us to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of these is the `if` statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print('x is positive')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The expression after the `if` is called the _condition_. If the condition is true, then the indented statement is executed. Otherwise, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` statements work like function definitions: A header followed by an indented body. Statements like these are called **compound statements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no limit to the number of statements you can have in the body, but you must have _at least_ one. Sometimes, you don't know what you want to put in the body yet, so instead, you can use the `pass` statement, which does nothing, and can be used as some sort of placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Execution\n",
    "Another form of the `if` statement is **Alternative Execution**. This is where you have two possibilities, and the condition determines which one gets done.\n",
    "e.g.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if x%2 == 0:\n",
    "    print('x is even')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('x is odd')\n",
    "```\n",
    "These alternatives are called **branches** because they branch the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chained Conditionals\n",
    "Sometimes there are more than two possibilities, and we need more than two branches. One way to express these is to use a **chained conditional**.\n",
    "e.g.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if x < y:\n",
    "    print('x is less than y')\n",
    "elif x > y:\n",
    "    print('x is greater than y')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('x and y are equal')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example, `elif` is an abbreviation of 'Else if'. Once again, only one branch gets executed. There is no limit on the amount of `elif` statements. If there's an `else` statement, it has to be at the end, but otherwise doesn't have to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Conditionals\n",
    "Conditionals can be nested in one another. Indentation makes it clear which one goes where, but can become difficult to read very quickly. Wherever possible, avoid using too much of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursion\n",
    "It's possible to have a function call another. It's also possible for a function to call itself. This may seem odd, but is very useful, especially when programs have base cases that eventually get back to a simple, single solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that calls itself is *recursive*; the process is called **recursion**."

    "Chapter 7: Iteration\n",
    "=====\n",
    "## Multiple Assignment:\n",
    "As you might already know, it's perfectly ok to assign a value to a variable more than once. A new assignment causes an existing variable to take on a new value. However, it won't store its old value any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish between an assignment operation and a statement of equality. Because Python uses the equal sign (=) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a statement of equality. It is **not!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating Variables\n",
    "You can update variables with values based on their old ones, as shown:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = x+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, you can't update a variable that doesn't yet exist, since Python evaluates whatever's on the left before executing what's on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can update any variable, you need to **initialise** it, usually with a simple assignment:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> x = 0\n",
    ">>> x = x+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The process of adding to an existing variable is called *incrementing*. To subtract is to *decrement*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `while` statement\n",
    "For the sake of doing repetitive tasks, we need to keep repeating things, or as it's called in computer science, **iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the methods Python offers which we already know is the `for` statement. Now, we'll introduce the `while` statement.\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        print n\n",
    "        n = n-1\n",
    "    print('Blastoff!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can read `while` statements almost as if they're English - 'while n is greater than zero, do...'\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, here's how the `while` statement works:\n",
    "1) Evaluate the condition, getting `True` or `False`.\n",
    "2) If the condition is `False` then exit the `while` statement and continue executing the rest of the code.\n",
    "3) If the condition is `True`, then execute the body and return to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow is also known as a **loop** because the third step 'loops' back to the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an *infinite loop*. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an infinite loop. (I'm sorry we're lame.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## `break`\n",
    "Sometimes you can't tell when to end the loop, or you need to end it early without it going through everything. In that case, you can use the `break` statement to have the loop exit itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a popular way to write `while` loops because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop and get it to stop whenever you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Square Roots\n",
    "Loops are often use in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an approximate number and iteratively improving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Computing square roots with Newton's Method:\n",
    "You keep repeating the estimate formula for what you're looking for:\n",
    "```\n",
    "y = (x + a/x) / 2\n",
    "y = x\n",
    "# loop to find the square root of a with a starting estimate x\n",
    "```\n",
    "For most values of a this works fine, but in general it is dangerous to test float equality. Floating-point values are only approximately right: most rational numbers, like 1/3, and irrational numbers, like the square root of 2, can’t be represented exactly with a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than checking whether x and y are exactly equal, it is safer to use the built-in function abs to compute the absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if abs(y-x) < epsilon:\n",
    "    break\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where epsilon has a value like 0.0000001, that determines how close is close enough for your estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",
    "The method outlined above is an example of an `algorithm`: A mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this case, a square root)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to *define* an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "It might help to start with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorizing the solutions is utterly useless - instead you should be focusing on the design of an algorithm, because that's literally how you solve problems in real life, like doing math.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging More Complex Programs:\n",
    "As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "More code means more chances to make an error and more place for bugs to hide. One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there are `100` lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take `100` steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the first half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half. Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search.\n",
    "\n",
    "After six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory. In practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible to check it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It *doesn’t make sense* to count lines and find the **exact** midpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about places in the program where there **might be errors** and places where *it is easy to put a check*. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check."

    "A dictionary is like a list, but in a more general way. In a list, indices have to be integers, but in a dictionary, they can be of (almost) any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a dictionary as its paper namesake: you map the indices (known as **keys** here) to a set of values (in the paper form, a word to a meaning). This association is called a **key-value pair** or sometimes, an *item*.\n",

    "The function `dict()` creates a new dictionary with no items. Because `dict` is the name of a built-in function, you should not name any variable with it.\n",

    ">>> print eng2sp\n",

    "```\n",
    "This line creates an item that maps the key `one` to the value, `uno`. If we print the dictionary again, we see the key-value pairs with a colon between each key and the value:\n",

    ">>> print eng2sp\n",
    "{'one': 'uno'}\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "As shown, the order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type it on your PC in IDLE, it might be different. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable. But that's not an issue, since the items in a dictionary are indexed by key instead of by order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the key-value pairs are supposed to be unique, calling the key will *always* get you the value. If the key isn't in the dictionary, well, you get an exception: \n",

    "KeyError: 'four'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `len` operator works on dictionaries. So does the `in` operator, which tells you whether something you ask for is within the stated variable. For dictionaries, this tells you if it's within the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if something appears in the values of the dictionary, you can use the method `values`, which returns the values of the dictionary in a list. You can then use the `in` operator to check the values.\n",

    "## Dictionary as a set of counters\n",
    "Suppose that you have a string of characters and want to count how many times each letter appears. You could do it a few ways:\n",
    "1) Create 26 variables, one for each letter. Traverse the string, and then increment the counter for each character using a chained conditional.\n",
    "2) Create a list of 26 elements. Convert each character to a number, use the number as an index to the list, increment the appropriate counter.\n",
    "3) Create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as values - the first time you see each character, you add the item to the dictionary. Increment the values of existing items accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these options performs the same computation, but implements each differently.\n",
    "**Implementation** is a way of performing a computation - some implementations are better than others. e.g.: in our dictionary example, we don't need to know which letters will appear in the string and only have to make room for those that do appear.\n",

    "    for c in h:\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately no simple syntax exists to help you do this particular thing - you have to search.\n",
    "Here's the sample code:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we ever come to the end of the loop, it means that the value isn't found, so we raise the exception.\n",

    "Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you were given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be a list of letters.\n",

    "A dictionary is implemented with a **hashtable** which means that the keys need to be **hashable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hash** is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This system works fine if the keys are *immutable* (that is, unchanging). But if the keys are mutable, like lists, *bad things happen*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Global Variables\n",
    "Variables in `__main__`, that is, created in the main body of the program, are sometimes called **global**. They can be accessed from any function, but ***cannot*** be assigned from within a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common that global variables are used as *flags*. That is, boolean variables that indicate ('flag') if a condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:\n",

    "def example2():\n",
    "    been_called = True # WRONG\n",
    "```\n",
    "But if you run it you will see that the value of `been_called` doesn’t change. The problem is that `example2` creates a new local variable named `been_called`. The local variable goes away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a global variable from inside a function, you must **declare** the global variable before you use it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "been_called = False\n",
    "def example2():\n",
    "    global been_called\n",
    "    been_called = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `global` statement tells Python that when you ask for `been_called`, you're referring to the one in the global space, and not to create a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yu can add, remove and replace elements of a global list or dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable, you have to declare it:\n",
