    "Chapter 1: The Way of the Program:\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Program?\n",
    "Programs are sequences of instructions that specify how to perform certain computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is hence the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until they're simple enough to fall into these certain categories of basic instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *input*: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device\n",
    "* *output*: Display data on the screen, or send data to some other device\n",
    "* *math*: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication\n",
    "* *conditional execution*: Check for certain conditions, and execute appropriate instructions\n",
    "* *repetition*: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Quick Glossary of Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is error-prone, and errors are termed __bugs__, and the process of tracking them down is called __debugging__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Errors\n",
    "Programming languages can only execute programs fully if the syntax (the grammar) is correct. Otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message. __Syntax__ refers to the structure of the program, and what rules it has to obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. parentheses \"()\" have to come in matching pairs, so `(1+2)` is legal, but `8)` throws up a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime Errors\n",
    "Runtime errors are exactly as they describe: Errors that don't happen until the program starts running. They are also called **exceptions** because they indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're quite rare because they usually occur in larger programs, where there's more to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Errors\n",
    "If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that the program logic you've written is not what you intended to write. It usually requires work to figure out where the logic goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Debugging\n",
    "While annoying, debugging is one of the most rewarding and interesting parts of programming, at least for people who like intellectual challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, it's like detective work, while debugging, in a way, is also a kind of programming - you're programming to get the computer to work the way you intended the program to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal And Natural Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language\n",
    "Usually evolves naturally (**duh**). Doesn't always have proper rules that must always be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Language\n",
    "Designed by people for specific applications, and has a specific **_Syntax_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `3 + 2 = 5` is an okay mathematical expression, but: `3+ = 52**` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reading a language so that you understand its meaning is called **parsing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences between Natural & Formal Language:\n",
    "* **Ambiguity**\n",
    "While natural language is full of ambiguity, where people develop meaning from context and textual clues, formal language is designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, where any statement has exactly one meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundancy**\n",
    "In order to make up for the ambiguity of Natural Language, they employ a lot of redundancy. As a result, it's quite verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Literalness**\n",
    "Natural languages are full of additional symbolic meanings beyond the definitions of their words.\n",
    "Formal languages mean literally what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparing Formal & Natural Language through Poetry and Prose\n",
    "* **Poetry**\n",
    "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prose**\n",
    "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Program**\n",
    "The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Babby's First Program\n",
    "Traditionally, it's something that shows the phrase \"Hello, World!\" on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python 3, it's expressed as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "which nets you the result \"hello, world!\" on your screen when run.\n"

    "Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, Statements\n",
    "======\n",
    "## Values and Types\n",
    "A *Value* is one of the basic things that a program will work with, like a number, or some letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have **types**:\n",
    "1. `2` is an integer\n",
    "2. `\"hello world!\"` is a string (named so because it's a 'string' of letters, and identified by quotation marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsure what type the value you're looking at is, the Python interpreter can tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type('Hello, World!')\n",
    "<type 'str'>\n",
    ">>> type(17)\n",
    "<type 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`'str'` is the shortform for string, and `'int'` is the shortform for integer. Other, less-obvious types include `'float'`, or floating-point numbers (decimals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other quirks occur when you try to enter numbers in human-readable format into the interpreter:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 1,000,000\n",
    "(1, 0, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Not exactly what we expected at all. Python instead interprets the numbers entered as comma-separated integers - which is the first example of a _**Semantic Error**_: The code runs fine, but not to our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of any programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**.\n",
    "Variables are names that in turn refer to specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **assignment statement** creates new variables and gives them values:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> message = 'And now for something completely different'\n",
    ">>> n = 17\n",
    ">>> pi = 3.1415926535897932\n",
    "```\n",
    ">Note:\n",
    ">Python is practically unique in its handling of variables - it automatically assigns them types based on the input you hand to it. You may have noticed this in our earlier semantic error: '1,000,000' somehow means '1,0,0' to the interpreter. This is part of the more human-friendly philosophy behind Python. It believes that people shouldn't have to manually define variables every time they need them, and specify their use. Also, Python's remarkably flexible about assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes three assignments:\n",
    "The first assigns a string to a variable named _message_.\n",
    "The second assigns the integer 17 to a variable named _n_.\n",
    "The third assigns a floating point number to a variable named _pi_.\n",
    "\n",
    "On paper, you use a ***state diagram*** to represent the variables, with arrows pointing to the variable's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Names and Keywords\n",
    "Programmers generally choose names for their variables such that they are meaningful - they should document what the variable is for.\n",
    "Variables can have arbitrary name lengths. They can contain both letters and numbers, but _**MUST**_ start with a letter. You _can_ choose to use uppercase letters first, but it's better practice to begin variable names with lowercase letters first. (This will be explained later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscore character, `_`, can appear in names - they're usually used in names with multiple words, like `airspeed_of_unladen_swallow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you give a variable an illegal name, you'll get a syntax error.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 76trombones = 'big parade'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    ">>> more@ = 1000000\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    ">>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`76trombones` is illegal because it starts with a number. `more@` is illegal because it contains an illegal character, and `class` is illegal... because the word 'class' is a reserved name for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note:\n",
    ">Python has things like reserved names because of the nature of its readability - it'll be much the same for other languages too, since, well, they all need some sort of language for communicating in, but Python especially, since it needs those names to manage its internal functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreters use **keywords** to identify the structure of a program, and it just so happens that `class` is one of them, so they can't be used as variable names - they're _reserved_ names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of names for Python 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "and del from not while\n",
    "as elif global or with\n",
    "assert else if pass yield\n",
    "break except import print\n",
    "class nonlocal in raise\n",
    "continue finally is return\n",
    "def for lambda try\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators and Operands\n",
    "**Operators** are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values which you apply these operations to are called **operands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators `+,-,*,/,//,%` and `**` addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo and exponentiation, as in the following examples:\n",
    "```\n",
    "20+32 hour-1 hour*60+minute minute/60 5**2 (5+9)*(15-7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In some other languages, ^ is used for expoentiation, but in Python, it's a bitwise operator called *eXclusive OR*, or **XOR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3, fortunately, supports normal division correctly now - floor division is a thing of the past, and the old errors regarding 5/3 don't give you rubbish truncated results like 1 now. If you still want those truncated results, use the `//` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Statements\n",
    "An **expression** is a combination of values, variables and operators. A value by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so all of these are legal combinations, assuming that `x` has been assigned a value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "17\n",
    "x\n",
    "x + 17\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment. The important difference between statements and expressions are that *expressions have values*, but *statements do not*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order of Operations\n",
    "Fortunately, as with regular math, Python obeys the **BODMAS/PEMDAS** rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parentheses | Brackets: Anything inside parentheses (aka '()') gets evaluated first. This applies the same as in math.\n",
    "* Exponentials | Orders: Next up is stuff to the power of other things, like 2 to the 2nd power (4)\n",
    "* Multiplication\n",
    "* Division\n",
    "* Addition\n",
    "* Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Operations\n",
    "In general, In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'2'-'1' 'eggs'/'easy' 'third'*'a charm'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `+` operator works with strings, but it doesn't do things as you might expect. It *concatenates* the strings together, which means joining them end-to-end. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = \"alpha\"\n",
    "b = \"omega\"\n",
    "print(a+b)\n",
    ">>> alphaomega\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `*` operator also works on strings - it performs repetition. However, if one of the operands is a string, the other ***must*** be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commenting\n",
    "As programs get bigger, you'll need to start making your own notes in the program to help you keep track of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you use the `#` operator - which marks out everything after it as a comment."
