    "Chapter 1: The Way of the Program:\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Program?\n",
    "Programs are sequences of instructions that specify how to perform certain computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is hence the process of breaking down a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until they're simple enough to fall into these certain categories of basic instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *input*: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device\n",
    "* *output*: Display data on the screen, or send data to some other device\n",
    "* *math*: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication\n",
    "* *conditional execution*: Check for certain conditions, and execute appropriate instructions\n",
    "* *repetition*: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Quick Glossary of Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is error-prone, and errors are termed __bugs__, and the process of tracking them down is called __debugging__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax Errors\n",
    "Programming languages can only execute programs fully if the syntax (the grammar) is correct. Otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message. __Syntax__ refers to the structure of the program, and what rules it has to obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. parentheses \"()\" have to come in matching pairs, so `(1+2)` is legal, but `8)` throws up a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime Errors\n",
    "Runtime errors are exactly as they describe: Errors that don't happen until the program starts running. They are also called **exceptions** because they indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're quite rare because they usually occur in larger programs, where there's more to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Errors\n",
    "If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that the program logic you've written is not what you intended to write. It usually requires work to figure out where the logic goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Debugging\n",
    "While annoying, debugging is one of the most rewarding and interesting parts of programming, at least for people who like intellectual challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, it's like detective work, while debugging, in a way, is also a kind of programming - you're programming to get the computer to work the way you intended the program to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal And Natural Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language\n",
    "Usually evolves naturally (**duh**). Doesn't always have proper rules that must always be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Language\n",
    "Designed by people for specific applications, and has a specific **_Syntax_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `3 + 2 = 5` is an okay mathematical expression, but: `3+ = 52**` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reading a language so that you understand its meaning is called **parsing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences between Natural & Formal Language:\n",
    "* **Ambiguity**\n",
    "While natural language is full of ambiguity, where people develop meaning from context and textual clues, formal language is designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, where any statement has exactly one meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundancy**\n",
    "In order to make up for the ambiguity of Natural Language, they employ a lot of redundancy. As a result, it's quite verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Literalness**\n",
    "Natural languages are full of additional symbolic meanings beyond the definitions of their words.\n",
    "Formal languages mean literally what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparing Formal & Natural Language through Poetry and Prose\n",
    "* **Poetry**\n",
    "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prose**\n",
    "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Program**\n",
    "The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Babby's First Program\n",
    "Traditionally, it's something that shows the phrase \"Hello, World!\" on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python 3, it's expressed as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "which nets you the result \"hello, world!\" on your screen when run.\n"
